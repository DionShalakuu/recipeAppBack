# Getting Started with the Recipe Finder App

This project consists of a frontend and a backend component. Follow the steps below to set it up:

## Backend Setup:

git repo : `https://github.com/DionShalakuu/recipeAppBack`

1. Clone the backend repository.
2. Create a MySQL database named "recipes_finder".
3. Import the tables from the `.sql` file located in the `db` folder of the backend repository.
4. Install all dependencies by navigating to the backend directory and running `npm install`.
5. Start the backend server by running `npm start`.

## Frontend Setup:

git repo : `https://github.com/DionShalakuu/recipeApp`

1. Clone the frontend repository.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Once the backend server is running, start the frontend server by running `npm start`.
4. Access the application in your web browser using the provided URL.

## Core Functionalities:

- The frontend of the application utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design, axios for making HTTP requests, react-router-dom for routing, and Redux for state management.
- The backend utilizes libraries such as CORS, Express for creating routes, dotenv for managing environments, nodemon for automatic server restarts, UUID for generating random IDs, and mysql2 for database interaction.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up and run the Recipe Finder App on your local machine.
